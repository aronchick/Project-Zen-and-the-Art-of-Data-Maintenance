### What is this?

You know how they say 80% of Machine Learning is data preparation? Well, I decided to write a book about the 80%.

I started with the goal of writing a short, practical guide. I blinked, and now it's a 26-chapter, 6-appendix monstrosity that covers everything from Andrew Ng's philosophy to the mathematical proofs for things I barely understood myself. It's less of a book and more of a strategic manual for navigating the data jungle armed with more than just a rusty `df.dropna()`.

The core philosophy is simple: **"Garbage In, Garbage Out" is the silent killer of AI projects.** This book is an attempt to perform an exorcism on the "Garbage In" demon.

### This is a Cry for Help

I've stared at this table of contents for so long that the words "Imputation" and "Dimensionality" have lost all meaning. I need fresh eyes before I send this behemoth to an editor.

**I'm looking for your brutal, merciless, and invaluable feedback on:**

* **Is This Insane?** Is a 26-chapter book on data prep a noble quest or a sign of a complete psychological break?
* **What Did I Miss?** Did I forget your favorite esoteric encoding technique? Is there a new data architecture from Netflix that renders Chapter 3 obsolete?
* **Does It Make Sense?** Does the flow from "The Data-Centric Revolution" to "Quantum Computing Implications" feel like a logical progression or a fever dream?
* **Technical Blunders:** Have I misinterpreted a core concept? Is my explanation of MCAR vs. MAR going to get me laughed out of the next data science meetup?
* **Typos & Gibberish:** Point out anything that looks like I fell asleep on the keyboard.

### How to Contribute

1.  **Read a Chapter (or a section):** Pick a topic that interests you or that you're an expert in. The Notion link for Chapter 1 is in the outline below.
2.  **Open an Issue:** Create a new GitHub Issue for any feedback. Please prefix the issue title with the chapter number, e.g., `[Chapter 10] Hashing Encoder explanation is confusing`.
3.  **No Feedback is Too Small:** From a simple typo to a full-blown philosophical disagreement about Feature Stores, I want to hear it all.

Thank you for being brave enough to look. Now, please tell me my baby isn't (that) ugly.
